# GitHub API Integration using Java 21 and Spring Boot

This project is a simple Spring Boot application that integrates with the GitHub API. The goal is to retrieve information about a user's public repositories, including repository names, owner logins, branch names, and the latest commit SHAs. It filters out forked repositories and handles error cases gracefully, providing meaningful error messages in case of issues such as a non-existent user.

The project demonstrates the use of RESTful web services, exception handling, and interaction with external APIs. It also includes integration tests to verify the correctness of the implementation.

## Capabilities

- List Repositories: Retrieves all public repositories of a specified GitHub user that are not forks.

- Repository Details: For each repository, fetches branch names and the latest commit SHAs.

- Error Handling: Returns a 404 error response with a descriptive message for non-existent users.

- Integration Tests: Verifies the correctness of the API responses for various test cases, such as existing users, non-existing users, and repositories.

- No Pagination: The solution does not use pagination for API responses (as per the task requirements).

- No Authentication Required: The application does not require authentication for accessing GitHubâ€™s public API.
